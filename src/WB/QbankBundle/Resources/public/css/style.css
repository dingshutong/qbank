/*

IMPORTANT:

All styles live in the ../scss folder. To generate CSS files, use Compass or any other SASS/SCSS compilers.
Current Compass compiler generates a single output file bootstrap.css with all other stylesheets imported in it.

The file _qbank-styles.scss includes the custom non bootstrap css code for the Qbank. You should manually generate the
bootstrap.min.css file yourself, it is not generated automatically by Compass.

scss <dir> root:
* Bootstrap <dir>           Has all Bootstrap scss components inside (almost )
* bootstrap.scss            Includes are defined here - also only this file gets compiled into ../css/bootstrap.min.css
* _qbank-styles.scss        Here we placed our style.css and started making it more dynamic
* _qbank-variables.scss     All customizable variables are here. This is the place where users will play!
