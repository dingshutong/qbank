    title_main: IHSN Question Bank
    text_main: Censuses, sample surveys and administrative data collection systems often aim to measure and monitor the same variable or statistic. However, differences in the formulation of questions, interviewer instructions or concept definitions can result in noncomparability of data across sources and time. The IHSN Question Bank (QBank), maintained by a network of international agencies, aims to address this by providing a central repository of international questionnaires, interviewer instructions, classifications, concepts and indicators. The QBank application provides comprehensive and readily usable metadata that can be easily exported for the design of data collection instruments.
